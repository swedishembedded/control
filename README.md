# Swedish Embedded Control Systems Toolbox

![cover](pictures/cover.png)

This is a control systems design library written in pure C that provides you
with advanced algorithms for control, state estimation and model identification
specifically designed for use on embedded systems. It has been adopted for use
with embedded systems and [Swedish Embedded Platform
SDK](https://github.com/swedishembedded/sdk)

- Community: https://swedishembedded.com/community
- Consulting: https://swedishembedded.com/consulting
- Training: https://swedishembedded.com/tag/training

It library is fully compatible with Zephyr RTOS so you can simply add it as a
module to your west.yml file and start using it.

It is focused on practical numerical methods that work best in realtime
embedded environment without any complex dependencies.

It uses no dynamic memory allocation. All operations are done on C
arrays. The functions provided by this library are generic implementations that
can be used to implement controllers that use specific array sizes.

# Building locally

The library core library should build just fine using the standard cmake
approach:

```
mkdir build
cmake ..
make && make test
```

# Building and running examples

The tests inside this repository are created to be buildable on top of Swedish
Embedded Platform SDK. If you are using 'swedishembedded/build:latest' docker
image then you should be able to simply run:

```
west init -l .
west update
./scripts/test
```

If you want to build locally, you should be able to do so by installing west,
running west init and then installing the SDK dependencies locally:

```
pip3 install -g west
mkdir workspace && cd workspace
# it is important that you clone into a workspace!
git clone git@github.com:swedishembedded/control.git
west init -l .
west update
../sdk/scripts/install-sdk
```

This will install several different cross compilation toolchains and all the
other tools you need in order to build firmware for a wide variety of
architectures.

To build and run individual tests on specific boards you can do like this:

```
west boards # list boards
west build -p -b <board> tests/ai -t run # build and run
west build -t run # do a subsequent run after building for the first time
```

# Building documentation

``` shell
  apt update &&  
    apt install -qy 
    libglib2.0-dev
    libglib2.0-dev-bin
    libgtest-dev
    ruby2.7-dev
    libcairo2-dev
    libpango1.0-dev
    libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev
    libxml2-dev
  pip install asciidoxy
  gem install asciidoctor-mathematical
  mkdir build &&
    cd build &&
    cmake .. &&
    make docs
```

# How to help to build on this control toolbox

If you are interested in contributing to this library, feel free to raise a pull
request.

# GNU Octave Functions
Installing GNU Octave's Control-Toolbox or MATLAB's Control-Toolbox/System
Identification Toolbox WILL cause problems with this toolbox because they are
using the same function names. This toolbox implements better versions of the
original functions so you should either use this toolbox inside you .m file or
opt for using the default gnuoctave implementations - but not both.

# Tests

This is a major TODO for this source code: there is a basic test framework in
place, but we need actual automated tests that verify results. Currently the
tests have form of examples which compile and run, but do not verify the
results. We need to add Unity macros for checking test results. Unity is
already supported, only the test assertions themselves need to be added.

# Papers:

This library contains realization identification and polynomal algorithms. They
can be quite hard to understand, so I highly recommend to read papers in the
"reports" folder about the realization identification algorithms if you want to
understand how they work. 

### OKID - Observer Kalman Filter Identification
OKID is an algoritm that creates the impulse makrov parameter response from
data for identify a state space model and also a kalman filter gain matrix. Use
this if you got regular data from a dynamical system. This algorithm can handle
both SISO and MISO. OKID have it's orgin from Hubble Telescope at NASA. This
algorithm was invented 1991. The drawback with OKID algorithm is that it's very
extremely sensitive to noise. So I have modify OKID by including SINDy
algorithm and Euler simulation plus Algebraic Riccati Equations for finding the
discrete kalman gain matrix K. So now it's very robust against noise.

```matlab
[sysd, K] = okid(u, y, t, sampleTime);
```

### Example OKID

Here I programmed a Beijer PLC that controls the multivariable cylinder system.
It's a nonlinear system, but OKID can handle it because it's not so nonlinear as
a hydraulic motor. Cylinder 0 and Cylinder 1 affecting each other when the
propotional control valves opens.

```matlab
% Load the data
X = csvread('MultivariableCylinders.csv');
t = X(:, 1);
r0 = X(:, 2);
r1 = X(:, 3);
y0 = X(:, 4);
y1 = X(:, 5);
sampleTime = 0.1;

% Transpose the CSV data
u = [r0';r1'];
y = [y0';y1'];
t = t';

% Create the model
[sysd, K] = okid(u, y, t, sampleTime);

% Do simulation
[outputs, T, x] = lsim(sysd ,y, t);
close
plot(T, outputs(1, :), t, y(1, :))

### RLS - Recursive Least Squares
RLS is an algorithm that creates a transfer function model from regular data.
Here you can select if you want to estimate an ARX model or an ARMAX model,
depending on the number of zeros in the polynomal "nze". Select number of
error-zeros-polynomal "nze" to 1, and you will get a ARX model or select "nze"
equal to model poles "np", you will get an ARMAX model that also includes a
kalman gain matrix K. I recommending that. This algorithm can handle data with
high noise, but you will only get a SISO model from it. This algorithm was
invented 1821 by Gauss, but it was until 1950 when it got its attention in
adaptive control.

Use this algorithm if you have regular data from a open loop system and you want
to apply that algorithm into embedded system that have low RAM and low flash
memory. RLS is very suitable for system that have a lack of memory.

```matlab
[sysd, K] = rls(u, y, np, nz, nze, sampleTime, forgetting);
```

### Example RLS

This is a hanging load of a hydraulic system. This system is a linear system due to the hydraulic cylinder that lift the load. Here I create two linear first order models. One for up lifting up and one for lowering down the weight. I'm also but a small orifice between the outlet and inlet of the hydraulic cylinder. That's create a more smooth behavior. Notice that this RLS algorithm also computes a Kalman gain matrix.

![a](pictures/RLS_System.jpg)

```matlab
% Load data
X = csvread('HangingLoad.csv');
t = X(:, 1); % Time
r = X(:, 2); % Reference 
y = X(:, 3); % Output position
u = X(:, 4); % Input signal from P-controller with gain 3
sampleTime = 0.02;
 
% Do identification of the first data set
l = length(r) + 2000; % This is half data

% Do identification on up and down
sysd_up = rls(r(1:l/2), y(1:l/2), 1, 1, 1, sampleTime);
sysd_down = rls(r(l/2+1:end), y(l/2+1:end), 1, 1, 1, sampleTime);

% Simulate 
[~,~,x] = lsim(sysd_up, r'(1:l/2), t'(1:l/2));
hold on
lsim(sysd_down, r'(l/2+1:end), t'(l/2+1:end), x(:, end));
hold on
plot(t, y);
legend('Up model', 'Down model', 'Measured');
title('Hanging load - Hydraulic system')
xlabel('Time [s]')
ylabel('Position');
````

Here we can se that the first model follows the measured position perfect. The "down-curve" should be measured a little bit longer to get a perfect linear model.

### ERA/DC - Eigensystem Realization Algorithm Data Correlations
ERA/DC was invented 1987 and is a successor from ERA, that was invented 1985 at NASA. The difference between ERA/DC and ERA is that ERA/DC can handle noise much better than ERA. But both algorihtm works as the same. ERA/DC want an impulse response. e.g called markov parameters. You will get a state space model from this algorithm. This algorithm can handle both SISO and MISO data.

Use this algorithm if you got impulse data from e.g structural mechanics.

```matlab
[sysd] = eradc(g, sampleTime, systemorder);
```
### Example ERA/DC

### OCID - Observer Controller Identification
This is an extention from OKID. The idea is the same, but OCID creates a LQR contol law as well. This algorithm works only for closed loop data. It have its orgin from NASA around 1992 when NASA wanted to identify a observer, model and a LQR control law from closed loop data that comes from an actively controlled aircraft wing in a wind tunnel at NASA Langley Research Center. This algorithm works for both SISO and MIMO models.

Use this algorithm if you want to extract a LQR control law, kalman observer and model from a running dynamical system. Or if your open loop system is unstable and it requries some kind of feedback to stabilize it. Then OCID is the perfect choice.

```matlab
[sysd, K, L] = ocid(r, uf, y, sampleTime, regularization, systemorder);
```

### SINDy - Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics
This is a new identification technique made by ![Eurika Kaiser](https://github.com/eurika-kaiser) from University of Washington. It extends the identification methods of grey-box modeling to a much simplier way. This is a very easy to use method, but still powerful because it use least squares with sequentially thresholded least squares procedure. I have made it much simpler because now it also creates the formula for the system. In more practical words, this method identify a nonlinear ordinary differential equations from time domain data.

This is very usefull if you have heavy nonlinear systems such as a hydraulic orifice or a hanging load. 

### SINDy Example

This example is a real world example with noise and nonlinearities. Here I set up a hydraulic motor in a test bench and measure it's output and the current to the valve that gives the motor oil. The motor have two nonlinearities - Hysteresis and the input signal is not propotional to the output signal. By using two nonlinear models, we can avoid the hysteresis.

% Load CSV data

### IDBode - Identification Bode
This plots a bode diagram from measurement data. It can be very interesting to
see how the amplitudes between input and output behaves over frequencies. This
can be used to confirm if your estimated model is good or bad by using the
`bode` command from this toolbox and compare it with idebode.

```matlab
idbode(u, y, w);
```

### IDBode Example

![a](pictures/IDBODE_System.png)

```matlab
%% Model of a mass spring damper system
M = 5; % Kg
K = 100; % Nm/m
b = 52; % Nm/s^2
G = tf([1], [M b K]);

%% Frequency response
t = linspace(0.0, 50, 3000);
w = linspace(0, 100, 3000);
u = 10*sin(2*pi*w.*t);

%% Simulation
y = lsim(G, u, t);
close

%% Identify bode diagram
idbode(u, y, w);

%% Check
bode(G);
```

![a](pictures/IDBODE_Result.png)

### SPA - Spectral Analysis
This plots all the amplitudes from noisy data over its frequencies. Very good to see what type of noise or signals you have. With this, you can determine what the real frequencies and amplitudes are and therefore you can create your filtered frequency response that are clean.

```matlab
[amp, wout] = spa(y, t);
```

### SPA Example

Assume that we are using the previous example with different parameters.

```matlab
%% Model of a mass spring damper system
M = 1; % Kg
K = 500; % Nm/m
b = 3; % Nm/s^2
G = tf([1], [M b K]);

%% Frequency response
t = linspace(0.0, 100, 30000);
u1 = 10*sin(2*pi*5.*t); % 5 Hz
u2 = 10*sin(2*pi*10.*t); % 10 Hz
u3 = 10*sin(2*pi*20.*t); % 20 Hz
u4 = 10*sin(2*pi*8.*t); % 8 Hz
u = u1 + u2 + u3 + u4;

%% Simulation
y = lsim(G, u, t);
figure

%% Noise
y = y + 0.001*randn(1, 30000); 

%% Identify what frequencies we had!
spa(y, t);
```

### Filtfilt2 - Zero Phase Filter
This filter away noise with a good old low pass filter that are being runned twice. Filtfilt2 is equal to the famous function filtfilt, but this is a regular .m file and not a C/C++ subroutine. Easy to use and recommended. 

```matlab
[y] = filtfilt2(y, t, K);
```

### Filtfilt2 Example

We are using the previous example here as well.

```matlab
%% Model of a mass spring damper system
M = 1; % Kg
K = 500; % Nm/m
b = 3; % Nm/s^2
G = tf([1], [M b K]);

%% Input signal
t = linspace(0.0, 100, 3000);
u = 10*sin(t);

%% Simulation
y = lsim(G, u, t);

%% Add 10% noise
load v
for i = 1:length(y)
  noiseSigma = 0.10*y(i);
  noise = noiseSigma*v(i); % v = noise, 1000 samples -1 to 1
  y(i) = y(i) + noise;
end

%% Filter away the noise
lowpass = 0.2;
[yf] = filtfilt2(y, t, lowpass);

%% Check
plot(t, yf, t, y);
legend("Filtered", "Noisy");
```

### Robust Principal Component Analysis
Robust principal component analysis(RPCA) is a great tool if you want to separate noise from data `X` into a matrix `S`. `RPCA` is a better tool than `PCA` because it using optimization and not only reconstructing the image using `SVD`, which `PCA` only does.

```matlab
[L, S] = rpca(X);
```
### Robust Principal Component Analysis example

```matlab
X = imread('bob.jpg'); % Load Mr Bob
X = rgb2gray(X);       % Grayscale 8 bit
X = double(X);         % Must be double 40 => 40.0
[L, S] = rpca(X);      % Start RPCA. Our goal is to get L matrix
figure(1)
imshow(uint8(X))       % Before RPCA
title('Before RPCA - Bob')
figure(2)
imshow(uint8(L))       % After RPCA
title('After RPCA - Bob')
```

![a](pictures/RPCA_Bob.png)

### Independent Component Analysis
Independent component analysis(ICA) is a tool if you want to separate independent signals from each other. This is not a filter algorithm, but instead of removing noise, it separate the disturbances from the signals. The disturbances are created from other signals. Assume that you have an engine and you are measuring vibration in X, Y and Z-axis. These axis will affect each other and therefore the signals will act like they are mixed. ICA separate the mixed signals into clean and independent signals.

```matlab
[S] = ica(X);
```

### Square Root Uncented Kalman Filter for parameter estimation

This is Uncented Kalman Filter that using cholesky update method (more stable),
instead of cholesky decomposition. This algorithm can estimate parameters to
very a complex function if data is available. This method is recursive and
implemented in this repository in C as well. Use this when you need to estimate
parameters to a function if you have data that are generated from that function.
It can be for example an object that you have measured data and you know the
mathematical formula for that object. Use the measured data with this algorithm
and find the parameters for the formula.

### Support Vector Machine with C code generation

This algorithm can do C code generation for nonlinear models. It's a very simple
algorithm because the user set out the support points by using the mouse
pointer. When all the supports are set ut, then the algorithm will generate C
code for you so you can apply the SVM model in pure C using supplied C
implementation in this repository.

All you need to have is two matrices, `X` and `Y`. Where the column length is the data and the row length is the amount of classes.
The `svm.m` file will plot your data and then when you have placed out your support points, then the `svm.m` will generate C code for you that contains all the support points.

If you have let's say more than two variables, e.g `Z` matrix or even more. Then you can create multiple models as well by just using diffrent data as arguments for the `svm` function below. The C code generation is very fast and it's very easy to build a model. 

```matlab
[X_point, Y_point, amount_of_supports_for_class] = svm(X, Y)
```

### Support Vector Machine with C code generation example

```matlab
% How much data should we generate 
N = 50;

% How many classes 
c = 5;

% Create variance and average for X and Y data
X_variance = [2, 4, 3, 4, 5];
Y_variance = [3, 5, 3, 4, 5];
X_average = [50, 70, 10, 90, 20];
Y_average = [20, 70, 60, 10, 20];

% Create scatter data
X = zeros(c, N);
Y = zeros(c, N);
for i = 1:c
  % Create data for X-axis 
  X(i, 1:N) = X_average(i) + X_variance(i)*randn(1, N);
    
  % Create data for Y-axis
  Y(i, 1:N) = Y_average(i) + Y_variance(i)*randn(1, N);
end
  
% Create SVM model - X_point and Y_point is coordinates for the SVM points.
% amount_of_supports_for_class is how many points there are in each row
[X_point, Y_point, amount_of_supports_for_class] = svm(X, Y);
  
% Do a quick re-sampling of random data again
for i = 1:c
  % Create data for X-axis 
  X(i, 1:N) = X_average(i) + X_variance(i)*randn(1, N);
    
  % Create data for Y-axis

# Model Predictive Control - Linear programming

Here I use MPC with linear programming. I used to use MPC with a quadratic programming, but unfortunately quadprog is only available for MATLAB and you need to have a license for that. So I wrote my own linear programming MPC with regularization for smoother outputs and inputs. The linear programming algorithm is available in C code as well in my other projects for embedded MPC systems, and that's the main reason why I selected a simple optimization solver instead of a large and difficult one.

# Usage with Octave

To use these algorithms in GNU octave, just add the path to the octave source
code to your octave project:
