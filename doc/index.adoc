This is a control systems design library written in pure C that provides you
with advanced algorithms for control, state estimation and model identification
specifically designed for use on resource constrained embedded systems.

It library is fully compatible with Zephyr RTOS so you can simply add it as a
module to your west.yml file and start using it.

It is focused on practical numerical methods that work best in realtime embedded
environment without any complex dependencies.

It uses no dynamic memory allocation. All operations are done on C arrays. The
functions provided by this library are generic implementations that can be used
to implement controllers that use specific array sizes.

== API Convention

All methods that are part of this library must adhere to following rules:

- A method may not modify input variables. All input variables should be
  declared const in the argument list.

- A method must support passing one of the input variables as output (ie tran(A,
  A) would mean transpose A and put result in A).

- All matrix and vector parameters must follow their mathematical notation.
  xout = Ax + Bu should translate to method(xout, A, x, B, u, size params...)

Following these rules makes the code both easier to maintain and use.
