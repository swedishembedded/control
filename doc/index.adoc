== Method call convention

All methods that are part of this library must adhere to following rules:

- A method may not modify input variables. All input variables should be
  declared const in the argument list.

- A method must support passing one of the input variables as output (ie tran(A,
  A) would mean transpose A and put result in A).

- All matrix and vector parameters must follow their mathematical notation.
  xout = Ax + Bu should translate to method(xout, A, x, B, u, size params...)

Following these rules makes the code both easier to maintain and use.
