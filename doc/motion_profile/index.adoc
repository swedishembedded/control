= Motion Profile

In control systems it is often necessary to generate a motion profile for a
controller. This is typically done by an "executive" controller that generates
setpoint for a lower level controller.

A motion profile is essentially a trapezoidal shape that defines position,
velocity and acceleration setpoints at any given time during the execution of a
move. A motion profile must start at a particular point in time and then for the
duration of the move it must resolve correct position, velocity and acceleration
setpoints until the move is completed.


== Initializing a motion profile

A motion profile is initialized using ${link("motion_profile_init")} function.
This function takes three parameters which define the trapezoidal shape of the
profile.

== Planning a move

A move can be planned using the ${link("motion_profile_plan_move")} function. It
takes as parameter the starting position and velocity and ending position and
velocity.


== Getting the setpoints

The setpoints for a particular time since start of the profile can be obtained
using the ${link("motion_profile_get_pva")} method which takes as a parameter
the absolute time offset since profile was started and calculates three
setpoints for the control action. This method returns profile status.


== Getting traversal time

Occasionally it may be necessary to get the total traversal time for a
particular profile. After you have planned a move, you can get the traversal
time using ${link("motion_profile_get_traversal_time")} function.


== Method description

This section describes equations that one can use to calculate position and
velocity setpoint value given a time along a preplanned path which has been
planned using desired distance traveled, velocity at start of travel, velocity
at end of travel, maximum velocity, desired acceleration and desired
deceleration. The solution is presented mathematically and full octave source
code is provided below.

=== Theory Of Profile Generation

Input variables:

- *acc* – maximum velocity rate of change when approaching maximum velocity
- *dec* – desired deceleration rate
- *vmax* – maximum velocity moving towards the target
- *vstart* – velocity when move starts
- *vend* – velocity when move ends
- *dstart* – position at start of the move
- *dend* – position we would like to travel to

The problem is not as simple as may seem at first because what we need to do is
find a solution to the following set of equations:

[stem]
++++
0 = (acc * t_1^2) / 2 + (dec * t_2^2) / 2 - dist + t_1 * vstart + t_2 * vmax + t_3 * vend
++++

[stem]
++++
0 = acc * t_1 - dec * t_3 - vend + vstart
++++

[stem]
++++
0 = acc * t_1 - vmax + vstart
++++

Not only that, but we also want our solution to work in both positive and
negative directions and we want to be able to execute all kinds of nontrivial
moves. Here are some examples of the types of moves we want to be able to do
(blue graph is position, green one is velocity):

image::img/motion_profile_1.jpg[]

*Illustration 1*: Start at 10, move to -2. At start of move your velocity is
-2, at end of the move it must be 1

image::img/motion_profile_2.jpg[]

*Illustration 2*: Start at 10, move to -2, your starting velocity is now 2
(positive direction) and your target velocity is 1. Velocity rate limit is
set at 4.

Note that on the second picture above the target position is reached twice.
This is entirely correct because we want to satisfy both the velocity
constraint of moving 1m/s forward and the position constraint which means we
have to move backwards and as quickly as possible. We also can not move at a
rate of more than 4m/s in that direction. So we have to first decelerate, then
as quickly as possible reach the maximum velocity moving towards the target,
but then as the target is reached the first time we also want now to reverse
the direction of movement so we go ahead and do this.  Thus we first satisfy
the positioning constraint as quickly as possible, but our velocity constraint
is not satisfied yet. Then we cross the target position the second time and
this time both our velocity constraint and our position constraint is
satisfied. The algorithm presented here handles these special cases
automatically.

Moreover, the solution has to support two distinct cases: one where maximum
velocity can be reached (which results in a trapezoidal profile) and one where
maximum velocity can not be reached (which results in a triangular profile).

image::img/motion_profile_3.jpg[]

*Illustration 3*: Move from -2 to 4. Maximum velocity of 4m/s can not be reached.

So how do we go about solving this?

=== The solution

We will use GNU octave to find the solution to the above system of equations.
The solution is not trivial to find manually because the system is nonlinear
(it includes squared time terms).

The first equation states that our total distances must equal the distance that
we want to travel.

[stem]
++++
    0 = (acc * t_1^2) / 2 + (dec * t_2^2) / 2 - dist + t_1 * vstart + t_2 * vmax + t_3 * vend
++++

(we will actually find two solutions – one for triangular profile and second one for trapezoidal one)
This is a sum of various terms that compose the total distance traveled:

image::img/motion_profile_4.jpg[]

*Illustration 4*: Equations

The second equation states that sum of all of our velocities from start to end must equal the
difference between starting and ending velocity:

[stem]
++++
0 = acc * t_1 - dec * t_3 - vend + vstart
++++

The third equation states that our final velocity after t1 must equal to vmax
(for the triangular case the solution to this extended system does not exist so
we have to solve a simpler system with only two equations).

[stem]
++++
0 = acc * t_1 - vmax + vstart
++++

To find the solution we use octave symbolics package and just define our symbols
and then let octave find the expressions for t1, t2 and t3 for f1 = 0, f2 = 0
and f3 = 0:

[source,octave]
--
	syms acc dec t1 t2 t3 vmax dist vstart vend
	f1 = (vstart * t1 + (acc * t1^2)/2) + (vend * t3 + (dec * t3^2) / 2) ­ dist
	f2 = vstart + acc * t1 ­ dec * t3 ­ vend
	s = solve(f1 == 0, f2 == 0, [t1, t3])

	syms acc dec t1 t2 t3 vmax dist vstart vend
	f1 = (vstart * t1 + (acc * t1^2)/2) + vmax * t2 + (vend * t3 + (dec * t3^2) / 2) ­ dist
	f2 = vstart + acc * t1 ­ dec * t3 ­ vend
	f3 = vstart + acc * t1 ­ vmax
	solve(f1 == 0, f2 == 0, f3 == 0, [t1, t2, t3])
--

The first system actually has two solutions. We are only interested in one that
creates positive time because negative time does not make sense to us.

Solution for triangular profile:

We can now implement our algorithm by first checking if trapezoidal profile is
possible by finding the velocity we reach after t1. If this value is higher than
the maximum then we have to calculate t1, t2 and t3 for trapezoidal profile. If
not then t2 = 0 and we just go ahead with the values we have calculated.

[source,octave]
--
	t1 = (-vend * (acc + dec) + sqrt((acc + dec) * (2 * acc * dec * dist + acc * vend * vend + dec * vstart * vstart)) + (acc + dec) * (vend - vstart)) / (acc *
	(acc + dec))
	t2 = 0
	t3 = (-vend * (acc + dec) + sqrt((acc + dec) * (2 * acc * dec * dist + acc * vend * vend + dec * vstart * vstart))) / (dec * (acc + dec))
	v2 = vstart + acc * t1
	if abs(v2) > abs(vmax)
		t1 = (vmax - vstart) / acc
		t2 = (2 * acc * dec * dist + acc * vend * vend - acc * vmax * vmax - dec * vmax * vmax + dec * vstart * vstart) / (2 * acc * dec * vmax)
		t3 = -(vend - vmax)/dec
	end
--

We can now go ahead and calculate our velocities at each stage and also our
distances so that we can then produce a solution that for any given time t will
give us our position and velocity.

[source,octave]
--
	v1 = vstart
	v2 = vstart + acc * t1
	v3 = vend
	d1 = v1 * t1 + (acc * t1^2)/2
	d2 = v2 * t2
	d3 = v3 * t3 + (dec * t3^2)/2
	dtotal = d1 + d2 + d3
--

The solution for any time t now becomes:

[source,octave]
--
	if t < t1
		v = v1 + acc * t;
		d = v1 * t + (acc * t^2) / 2;
	elseif t >= t1 && t < (t1 + t2)
		v = v2;
		d = d1 + (t ­ t1) * v2;
	elseif t >= (t1 + t2) && t < ttotal
		v = v2 ­ dec * (t ­ t1 ­ t2);
		d = dtotal ­ v3 * (ttotal ­ t) ­ (dec * (ttotal ­ t)^2) / 2;
	else
		v = v3;
		d = d1 + d2 +d3 + v3 * (t ­ ttotal);
	end
	d = dstart + d;
--

That’s it.
