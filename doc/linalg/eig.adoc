Eigenvalues are a special set of scalars associated with a linear system of
equations that are sometimes also referred to as characteristic roots,
characteristic values, proper values, or latent roots.

Equation stem:[(A − λI)v = 0] has a nonzero solution 'v' *if and only if* the
determinant of the matrix 'A − λI' is zero. Therefore, the eigenvalues of 'A'
are values of 'λ' that satisfy the equation:

[stem]
++++
A-\lambda I| = 0
++++

This equation is called the characteristic equation or the 'secular equation'
of A. This is useful when analyzing stability of a controlled system.
