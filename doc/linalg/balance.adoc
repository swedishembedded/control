${insert("balance")}

The errors in calculating the eigenvalues of a square real matrix are
proportional to the Frobenius norm of the matrix. Frobenius norm can be defined
as a trace of square of the matrix (trace is sum of elements of the diagonal
elements):

[stem]
++++
||A|| = \sqrt{trace(A*A)}
++++

The process of producing a matrix that is diagonally similar to the input matrix
which reduces the matrix norm is called "balancing the matrix".

This function transforms a matrix:


[latexmath]
++++
\begin{bmatrix} -0.1 & 10.0 \\ -1.0 & 5.0 \end{bmatrix}
++++

Into a balanced matrix:


[stem]
++++
\begin{bmatrix} -0.1 & 2.5 \\ -4.0 & 5.0 \end{bmatrix}
++++
