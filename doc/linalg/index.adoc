= Linear algebra building blocks

This library is designed to be self sufficient and usable across a wide range of
microcontrollers and other embedded and resource constrained systems. For this
reason, a simple, fast and fairly complete basic function library was needed.

Linear algebra module provides this functionality. Making it possible to build
more complex (and still simple) operations out of these basic building blocks.
