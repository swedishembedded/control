${insert("pid")}

This is a pid controller with optional derivative filter integrated into the
calculation. The derivative filter pole (parameter d) is a value of the discrete
(z-domain) pole of the low pass filter that filters the derivative signal.

The transfer function of this controller in discrete domain is:
