${insert("lqi")}

This is a linear quadratic regulator with integral state. In your controller you
would typically estimate error state instead of plant state so that you can
drive the error output to zero.

This means that you should compute the "measured" error as follows:

[stem]
++++
e = -(r - y)
++++

The reason it is negative is because we are working with error state here.
Suppose your plant is at zero (real state). You want to set the reference to 25.
Your error at this point between measurement and reference is +25. But for the
sake of control system design we should always set the reference to 0 because
that's what our mathematical algorithms try to do - drive error to zero. So we
simply assume that our plant is at -25 instead of 0 and so our error becomes
-25. Hence the minus in the error calculation.
